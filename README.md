# JS For Mecademic


An object-oriented JavaScript library for Mecademic robots.

## Why?

It's not important, but no one had ever written an open-source JavaScript library for an industrial robot yet so I thought it might be cool to be the first.

## Installation

Honestly I can't quite remember how to do node.js stuff so I'm gonna have to get back with you on that...

## Usage

Excellent question! Might have to come back and clean this up a bit first...

## Thanks

Thank you to the Mecademic web server source code for getting me connected to the robot as quickly as possible.
